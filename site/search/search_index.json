The calculator package can help you get this done. Download the code from this GitHub repository and place the calculator/ folder in the same directory as your Python script: your_project/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 calculator/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 calculations.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 your_script.py Inside of your_script.py you can now import the add() function from the calculator.calculations module: # your_script.py from calculator.calculations import add After you've imported the function, you can use it to add any two numbers that you need to add: # your_script.py from calculator.calculations import add print(add(20, 22)) # OUTPUT: 42.0 You're now able to add any two numbers, and you'll always get a float as a result.","title":"How to guides"},{"location":"how-to-guides/#how-to-add-two-numbers","text":"You have two numbers and you need to add them together.
