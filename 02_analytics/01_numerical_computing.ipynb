The answer is that no model is perfect, and sometimes, a bit of simulation can save you a lot of time in your work or within a project. In addition, there are analyses that are way too costly or harmful to run a test on and collect new data from. For example, flight routes, weather, car crashes, etc., and simulating scenarios in these use-cases would save a lot of time, money, effort, and even lives.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Lists in Python can be treated as the arrays and matrices that will hold our data for us. They are extremely powerful and versatile data structures and can be used in almost every aspect of the data analytics cycle.\n",
        "2. NumPy is a library built on top of the programming language C. This particular characteristic allows it to communicate with the hardware of our machines and run our computations faster than with regular Python code.\n",
        "3. When possible, use broadcasting instead of loops in order to optimise your code and run-time.\n",
        "4. Generating random data allows us to test models and functions very fast and numpy has a lot of useful methods to generate random data. It has functions such as `np.ones`, `np.random.random`, `np.linspace`, and many more.\n",
        "5. Masking is a type of filtering method that allows us to have a closer look at our data. It is, in a way, a similar way of constructing if-else evaluations.\n",
        "6. List comprehensions are a type of for loop that gives us the ability to generate a list from repeated commands.\n",
