# Introduction to Python 4 Data Analytics

Welcome to week 2 of data analytics with Python. Where you will be learning about numerical computations in Python using the backbone of data analytics and data science with Python. You will be learning a lot of new concepts so we hope you are well rested and ready to get started with this week's session.

Please have a careful look at the following outline as it contains everything you will be learning about today.

## Objectives

1. Introduce students to Python
2. Get students familiarized with JupyterLab and how to use this tool as efficiently as possible
3. Get students started with the Data Analytics Cycle
4. Provide students with a solid foundation on how Python is used in Data Analytics

## Outline for the day

### 1. What is Python? üêç

In the first section we will cover what is Python, what are some of its basic uses, and which libraries or packages should we pay attention to when we use it for data analytics.

### 2. Intro to JupyterLab

In section two we will cover Integrated Development Environments and what Jypyter Lab is all about. We will touch on each of its components and provide you with additional resources on how to supplement your knowledge of each.

### 3. Intro to Python

To get started with Python you will need some foundational knowledge of the basic concept. Here are the concepts we will cover in this section.

- Data Types
- Variables
- Printing
- Math
- Packages/Libraries
### 4. Essential of programming

Programming has many core concepts, and three of the absolute most important ones are loops, which allow us to do things repeatedly; functions, which help us save time by not having to re-write code everytime we do something; and if-then statements, which help us evaluate multiple criterion based on whether something is true or false.

- Conditional statements
- Functions
- Loops

### 5. Mini-Assessment

We will test your newly acquired knowledge with a mini-assessment where you will pick one of three tasks to involve users with. You will either write a comedy script, interview a user, or play trivia with a friend. Please access the notebook to learn more about how you will do this.

### 6. Intro to Git and GitHub

To make sure we are always keeping our work safe, and that if our computers were to break, we can be certain that we will never lose our work, we will be using Git and GitHub.

### 7. Summary

Recap of everything we covered in lesson 1.

### 8. Feedback

At the end of the lesson, there is a short survey that we would love to have you fill-up.

### 9. References

Where did we get some of our ideas from?

### 10. Weekly Exercises

The weekly exercises can be found in the Ed section of the course in Canvas. Please complete on or more of the exercises assigned to you for a particular day.
